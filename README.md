# Shapes

Shapes (Game)

This is a short game about identity written in Java, with no libraries or frameworks outside of the standard ones for math, data structures, and the inimitable JFrame. I designed the game engine and the levels, I wrote the story, and I hand-programmed the graphics and animations. Call it a love letter to the wonders of the Java language and the principles of Object Oriented Programming.

Why did I do this? What was I trying to prove? I don't know, but I sure learned a lot about coding. Above all, this project demonstrates my immense, nearly masochistic capacity for working through pain as a programmer, and solving problems with patience, debugging, and documentation. Imagine tailoring an animation pixel by pixel or wrangling with an IO Exception that only gets thrown three levels into the game.

If you want a sense of what the game is like, I've uploaded a couple videos that give a complete playthrough. If you really insist on playing it, you must have Java installed so that you can download and compile it. You may have to tweak your CLASSPATH.
