# Shapes

Shapes (Game)

This is a short game about identity written in pure, vanilla Java. Call it a love letter to the Java language and the wonderful principles of Object Oriented Programming - and, of course, to the inimitable JFrame.

The story, graphics, game engine, are all written by me. I used no external libraries other than the basic ones for math and data structures.

If you'd like to play it, you need to have Java installed on your machine; you can download and run the Shapes.jar file found here.
